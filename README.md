## Churn Analysis 
**Introduction**
The telecommunications company provides phone and internet services to more than 7,000 customers across California. However, they are facing a major business challenge, customer churn. Customer churn refers to when customers discontinue using the company’s services and move to competitors. This loss of customers negatively affects revenue, brand image, and overall growth potential.

The company wants to understand why customers are leaving, who they are, and what steps can be taken to retain them. This requires a detailed data-driven investigation of customer demographics, service usage, subscription types, contract durations, and payment behaviors.
